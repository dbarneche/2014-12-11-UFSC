# R bootcamp material

This `master` set is based on material from a [2-day bootcamp](https://github.com/swcarpentry/2013-10-09-canberra) I (@karthikram) ran in Canberra, Australia in October 2013. The material is meant to cover the full range of topics typically covered in a regular Python bootcamp. 

I've left out shell and git from here since various sets of material already exist in other lesson plans. Revisions and updates most welcome.
