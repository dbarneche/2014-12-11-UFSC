    performing calculations on values,
    sorting,
    handling NULLs,
    aggregating values,
    grouping,
    joining multiple tables,

    using a templating engine to create pages,
    how HTTP works,
    fetching data programmatically,
    providing data by dynamically generating static pages,
    why and how to create an index,
